# Using `alt` Attributes for Images

The `alt` (alternative text) attribute in HTML is used to provide a textual description of images in `<img>` elements. It plays a crucial role in web accessibility, SEO, and user experience.

#### Key Features of `alt` Attribute

1. **Accessibility**: 
   - The `alt` attribute helps visually impaired users understand the content of images through screen readers.
   - It ensures that all users, regardless of ability, can access the information conveyed by images.

2. **SEO Benefits**: 
   - Search engines use the `alt` text to understand the content and context of images, which can improve search rankings.
   - Well-written `alt` attributes can enhance the discoverability of images in search results.

3. **Display Text**: 
   - If an image fails to load (e.g., due to a slow connection or broken link), the `alt` text is displayed in place of the image, providing context to users.

#### Best Practices for Using `alt` Attributes

1. **Be Descriptive and Concise**:
   - Use clear and specific descriptions of the image content. Aim for brevity while conveying essential information.
   - Example:
     ```html
     <img src="cat.jpg" alt="A fluffy orange cat lying on a carpet">
     ```

2. **Avoid Redundancy**:
   - Do not include phrases like "image of" or "picture of." Just describe what is in the image.
   - Example (not recommended):
     ```html
     <img src="dog.jpg" alt="Image of a golden retriever">
     ```
   - Example (recommended):
     ```html
     <img src="dog.jpg" alt="Golden retriever playing with a ball">
     ```

3. **Use `alt` for Functional Images**:
   - For images that serve a functional purpose (like buttons or links), describe the action the image performs.
   - Example:
     ```html
     <img src="submit-button.jpg" alt="Submit form">
     ```

4. **Empty `alt` for Decorative Images**:
   - If an image is purely decorative and does not add meaningful content, use an empty `alt` attribute (`alt=""`). This indicates to screen readers to skip the image.
   - Example:
     ```html
     <img src="decorative-border.jpg" alt="">
     ```

5. **Consider Context**:
   - The meaning of an image may change depending on the surrounding text. Provide contextually relevant descriptions.
   - Example:
     ```html
     <p>Our new product, <img src="product.jpg" alt="Smartphone with a sleek design and vibrant display"> is now available!</p>
     ```

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Using `alt` as a Keyword Stuffing Tool**: Avoid cramming keywords into the `alt` attribute for SEO purposes. This can lead to poor user experience and is frowned upon by search engines.
  
- **Neglecting to Use `alt` Attributes**: Always include `alt` attributes for all `<img>` elements to enhance accessibility and SEO.

#### Example of Proper Usage

```html
<img src="family-pic.jpg" alt="A family of four enjoying a picnic in a sunny park">
<img src="decorative-line.jpg" alt="">
<img src="link-icon.png" alt="Go to home page">
```
